# Admin Panel Fixes

This document provides instructions to fix the non-functional approve/reject buttons in the admin property management panel.

## Problems Identified

1. **Missing Functionality**: The approve and reject buttons in the admin panel had no click handlers attached.
2. **Missing Backend Functions**: There were no functions to update property status in the backend.
3. **Missing Database Constraint**: The database didn't allow "rejected" status for properties.

## Solution

1. Added `updatePropertyStatus` function to `src/utils/supabaseData.ts`
2. Updated `PropertyManagement` component to handle approve/reject actions
3. Added database constraint for "rejected" status

## Instructions

1. Run the `ADD_REJECTED_STATUS.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor to update the database constraint
2. The code changes have already been applied to:
   - `src/utils/supabaseData.ts` (added updatePropertyStatus function)
   - `src/components/admin/PropertyManagement.tsx` (added click handlers and updated UI)

## What the Fix Does

- Adds approve/reject functionality to the admin panel
- Allows properties to have a "rejected" status
- Provides visual feedback when actions are performed
- Automatically refreshes the property list after actions
- Shows appropriate actions based on current property status

## After Applying the Fix

The approve and reject buttons in the admin panel should now work correctly:
- Pending properties will show "Approve" and "Reject" options
- Other properties will show "Set Available" option
- All actions will update the property status in the database
- Success/error messages will be displayed to the user
