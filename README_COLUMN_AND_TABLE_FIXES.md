# Column and Table Name Fix Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the column and table name inconsistencies that were identified and fixed in the application.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Table Name Mismatches
- **Missing Table**: The application expected a `property_viewings` table for scheduled viewings/appointments, but it didn't exist in the database
- **Incorrect References**: Code was trying to access `property_viewings` but the actual table was `property_views` (for page view tracking)

### 2. Column Name Mismatches
- **Viewing Date Column**: The code expected a `viewing_date` column, but the `property_views` table had a `viewed_at` column

### 3. Conceptual Confusion
- **Property Views**: For tracking page views (exists as `property_views`)
- **Property Viewings**: For scheduled appointments (was missing, now created as `property_viewings`)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`FIX_TABLE_NAMES.sql`)
- Created missing `property_viewings` table for scheduled viewings/appointments
- Defined proper schema with all required columns including `viewing_date`
- Added indexes for performance optimization
- Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Confirmed existing tables (`property_favorites`, `property_views`, `property_inquiries`)

### 2. API Layer Updates (`src/lib/api/index.ts`)
- Updated all references from `property_views` to `property_viewings` for viewing appointments
- Fixed `getUserViewings` function to use correct table and column names
- Maintained `property_views` references for actual page view tracking where appropriate

### 3. Data Access Layer (`src/utils/supabaseData.ts`)
- Confirmed correct table names are used for each data access function

## Files Modified

1. `FIX_TABLE_NAMES.sql` - Created missing `property_viewings` table and confirmed schema
2. `src/lib/api/index.ts` - Fixed table name references for viewing appointments
3. `README_TABLE_NAME_FIXES.md` - Updated documentation

## What the Fix Does

- Resolves the "column property_views.viewing_date does not exist" error
- Creates the missing `property_viewings` table for scheduled appointments
- Ensures proper separation between page view tracking and appointment scheduling
- Maintains data consistency between application code and database schema

## Database Tables Summary

### Existing Tables (Confirmed)
1. `property_favorites` - User saved properties
2. `property_views` - Page view tracking (with `viewed_at` column)
3. `property_inquiries` - Property inquiries

### New Table (Created)
1. `property_viewings` - Scheduled property viewings/appointments (with `viewing_date` column)

## Verification

After applying these fixes:
1. Run the `FIX_TABLE_NAMES.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. The dashboard should load without column or table name errors
3. Property viewing appointments will be stored in the correct table
4. Page view tracking will continue to work with the existing `property_views` table

## Future Considerations

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Regularly synchronize database schema with application code
2. Use database schema inspection tools to validate table and column existence
3. Maintain clear separation between different types of data (views vs. viewings)
4. Document table purposes and relationships clearly
