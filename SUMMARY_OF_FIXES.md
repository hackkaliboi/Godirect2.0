# Summary of Fixes for "owner_id column not found" Error

## Issues Identified

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The database had an `agent_id` column in the `properties` table, but the application code expected an `owner_id` column.

2. **Schema Cache Error**: This mismatch caused the "could not find the 'owner_id' column of 'properties' in the schema cache" error when trying to list a property.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Database Migration Script
- Created `FIX_OWNER_ID_COLUMN.sql` to rename `agent_id` to `owner_id` in the properties table
- Updated Row Level Security (RLS) policies to use `owner_id`
- Updated database indexes to use `owner_id`

### 2. Updated Application Code
- Verified that the TypeScript types already use `owner_id` (no changes needed)
- Confirmed all references to `agent_id` have been removed from the codebase

### 3. Updated Consolidated Database Fix
- Updated `CONSOLIDATED_DATABASE_FIX.sql` to use `owner_id` instead of `agent_id`
- Updated RLS policies to reference `owner_id`
- Updated storage policies to allow users (not just agents) to upload property images
- Removed 'agent' from user_type constraints
- Updated theme settings references

## Instructions to Apply Fixes

1. **Run the Database Migration**:
   - Execute `FIX_OWNER_ID_COLUMN.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
   - This will rename the column and update related policies

2. **Refresh Schema Cache**:
   - After running the migration, refresh your Supabase schema cache

3. **Test Property Listing**:
   - Try listing a property again to verify the error is resolved

## Future Considerations

- The updated `CONSOLIDATED_DATABASE_FIX.sql` now correctly uses `owner_id` for new setups
- All references to agents have been removed from the system
- Users now act as their own agents for properties they list

## Verification

After applying these fixes, you should be able to:
- List properties without encountering the schema cache error
- Successfully upload property images
- Manage properties as the owner
