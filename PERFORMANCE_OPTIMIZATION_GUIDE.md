# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Godirect Realty website to improve loading speed and user experience.

## 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

### Implementation
- Implemented lazy loading for all routes and components using React.lazy and Suspense
- Separated vendor chunks in Vite configuration for better caching
- Reduced initial bundle size by loading components only when needed

### Benefits
- Faster initial page load
- Reduced memory usage
- Improved Time to Interactive (TTI)

## 2. Image Optimization

### Implementation
- Added lazy loading for all images using the `loading="lazy"` attribute
- Implemented image loading states with skeleton placeholders
- Added error handling for missing images with fallback placeholders
- Used appropriate image dimensions to prevent layout shifts

### Benefits
- Reduced initial payload size
- Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Better user experience with loading indicators

## 3. Data Fetching Optimization

### Implementation
- Configured React Query with optimized caching settings:
  - `staleTime`: 5 minutes (data considered fresh for 5 minutes)
  - `gcTime`: 10 minutes (data cached for 10 minutes)
  - `refetchOnWindowFocus`: Disabled to prevent unnecessary requests
- Added pagination to property listings (9 properties per page)
- Used useMemo for expensive calculations and filtering operations
- Implemented efficient filtering and sorting algorithms

### Benefits
- Reduced API requests
- Faster data rendering
- Improved user experience with pagination

## 4. Component Optimization

### Implementation
- Added React.memo to PropertyCard component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used useMemo for expensive calculations in PropertyListings and FeaturedListings
- Implemented efficient state management patterns
- Added proper loading states and skeletons

### Benefits
- Reduced re-renders
- Improved rendering performance
- Better user experience with loading indicators

## 5. Build Optimization

### Implementation
- Configured Vite to create separate chunks for:
  - Vendor libraries (React, React DOM, React Router)
  - UI components (Radix UI)
  - Data libraries (React Query, Supabase)
  - Icons (Lucide React)
  - Charts (Recharts)
  - Maps (Google Maps API)
- Increased chunk size warning limit to 1000KB
- Added build analysis script (`npm run build:analyze`)

### Benefits
- Better caching strategies
- Parallel loading of resources
- Easier identification of large dependencies

## 6. Caching and Service Worker

### Implementation
- Added service worker for offline caching
- Implemented cache-first strategy for static assets
- Added cache cleanup for old versions

### Benefits
- Offline functionality
- Faster subsequent visits
- Reduced server load

## 7. HTML Optimizations

### Implementation
- Added DNS prefetch for external domains
- Added preconnect for critical external resources
- Added preload for critical images
- Optimized meta tags for better SEO and performance

### Benefits
- Faster DNS resolution
- Reduced connection time for external resources
- Improved loading of critical resources

## 8. Bundle Analysis

### New Scripts
- `npm run build:analyze` - Builds the project and shows bundle visualization

### Usage
Run this command to analyze the bundle size and identify optimization opportunities:
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Time until first content is rendered
2. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Time until largest content is rendered
3. **First Input Delay (FID)**: Time from first user interaction to browser response
4. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability of the page
5. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Time until page is fully interactive

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Component Optimization**
   - Always use React.memo for components that render lists
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Implement proper loading states

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Set appropriate staleTime and gcTime values
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement efficient filtering on the client side

3. **Image Handling**
   - Always use lazy loading for non-critical images
   - Provide appropriate alt text
   - Use responsive images when possible

4. **Bundle Management**
   - Regularly analyze bundle size
   - Avoid importing entire libraries when only using specific functions
   - Use code splitting for large components

5. **Caching**
   - Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
   - Implement service worker updates properly
   - Monitor cache performance

## Testing Performance

To test the performance improvements:

1. **Development Testing**
   - Use browser dev tools to monitor network requests
   - Check React dev tools for re-render performance
   - Monitor bundle size with the analyzer

2. **Production Testing**
   - Use Lighthouse to measure performance metrics
   - Test on various devices and network conditions
   - Monitor real user metrics (RUM)

These optimizations should significantly improve the loading speed and overall performance of the Godirect Realty website.
