# Recent Updates Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the recent updates and fixes made to the Godirect Realty platform, including both bug fixes and new feature implementations.

## 1. Database Schema Fix - "column property_views.viewing_date does not exist"

### Problem
The application was throwing an error when trying to load dashboard data because:
1. The code was incorrectly trying to access a `viewing_date` column in the `property_views` table
2. The `property_views` table is designed for tracking page views and has a `viewed_at` column instead
3. Scheduled property viewings (appointments) should be stored in a separate `property_viewings` table with a `viewing_date` column
4. The `property_viewings` table was missing from the database

### Solution
- Created the missing `property_viewings` table with the correct schema
- Updated application code to use the correct tables:
  - `fetchUserViewings` now queries `property_viewings` table
  - `fetchUserDashboardStats` now counts viewings from `property_viewings` table
  - `fetchUserRecentActivities` now fetches viewings from `property_viewings` table
- Verified API layer was already correctly using `property_viewings` table

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/supabaseData.ts` - Updated code to use correct tables
- `FIX_TABLE_NAMES.sql` - Created missing table
- Multiple documentation files explaining the fix

## 2. Dashboard Enhancements - "Back to Site" Button

### Problem
Users had no quick way to return to the main site from within the dashboard.

### Solution
Added a "Back to Site" button to the dashboard header that:
- Appears on medium screens and larger
- Uses a home icon for visual recognition
- Links directly to the main site (`/`)

### Files Modified
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` - Added the button

## 3. Home Page Enhancement - Offers Carousel

### Problem
The offers section on the home page used a static grid layout that didn't effectively showcase the offers.

### Solution
Converted the offers section to a responsive carousel that:
- Shows 1 item on mobile devices
- Shows 2 items on tablets
- Shows 3 items on desktops
- Includes navigation controls
- Loops continuously
- Maintains all original styling and functionality

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Converted grid to carousel

## 4. Documentation Updates

### Problem
Recent changes were not properly documented.

### Solution
Created comprehensive documentation for all changes:
- `README_VIEWING_TABLE_FIX.md` - Detailed explanation of the database fix
- `FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive summary of all changes
- `SUMMARY_OF_RECENT_FIXES.md` - Summary of recent fixes
- `FIX_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step verification guide

- `SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Updated system status report
- `COMPLETE_FIX_PACKAGE.md` - Complete package of all fixes
- `DASHBOARD_AND_OFFERS_UPDATES.md` - Summary of dashboard and offers updates

## 5. Helper Scripts

### Problem
Users needed an easy way to apply fixes.

### Solution
Created helper scripts to simplify the process:
- `RUN_FIX.sh` - Bash script to help apply the database fix
- `RUN_FIX.bat` - Windows batch script to help apply the database fix
- `TEST_VIEWING_FIX.sql` - SQL script to verify the database fix
- `CHECK_TABLES.sql` - SQL script to check table existence
