## Issue: "column property_views.viewing_date does not exist"

### Problem
The application was trying to access a `viewing_date` column in the `property_views` table, but this table is designed for tracking page views and has a `viewed_at` column instead. Scheduled property viewings (appointments) should be stored in a separate `property_viewings` table.

### Root Cause
Conceptual confusion between two different types of data:
1. Property views (page views/tracking when someone views a property listing)
2. Property viewings (scheduled appointments for visiting a property)

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Database Schema Fix
- Created the missing `property_viewings` table with the correct `viewing_date` column
- Ensured proper separation between page views and scheduled appointments
- Added appropriate indexes and Row Level Security (RLS) policies

#### 2. Code Fixes
Updated `src/utils/supabaseData.ts` to use the correct tables:

- `fetchUserViewings` now queries `property_viewings` table instead of `property_views`
- `fetchUserDashboardStats` now counts viewings from `property_viewings` table
- `fetchUserRecentActivities` now fetches viewings from `property_viewings` table

#### 3. API Layer
The API layer in `src/lib/api/index.ts` was already correctly using `property_viewings` table

### Files Modified
1. `src/utils/supabaseData.ts` - Fixed table references
2. `FIX_TABLE_NAMES.sql` - Created missing table
3. `README_VIEWING_TABLE_FIX.md` - Documentation of the fix

### Implementation Steps
1. Run the FIX_TABLE_NAMES.sql script in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. The code changes have already been applied

### Verification
After implementing these fixes, the dashboard should load correctly without the "column property_views.viewing_date does not exist" error.
