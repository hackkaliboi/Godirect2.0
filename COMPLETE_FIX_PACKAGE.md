# Complete Fix Package: "column property_views.viewing_date does not exist" Error

## Overview
This package contains all the necessary files and instructions to resolve the "column property_views.viewing_date does not exist" error in the Godirect Realty platform.

## Problem Summary
The application was throwing an error when trying to load dashboard data because:
1. The code was incorrectly trying to access a `viewing_date` column in the `property_views` table
2. The `property_views` table is designed for tracking page views and has a `viewed_at` column instead
3. Scheduled property viewings (appointments) should be stored in a separate `property_viewings` table with a `viewing_date` column
4. The `property_viewings` table was missing from the database

## Solution Components

- Updated `fetchUserViewings` to query `property_viewings` table
